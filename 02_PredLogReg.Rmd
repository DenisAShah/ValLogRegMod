## Steps
  
The steps taken in this file are:   
1. To assess the performance of the model in terms of calibration, discrimination and overall prediction error in a new independent (external) data.  
2. To assess the potential clinical utility the model using decision curve analysis.

### Data description
Men with metastatic non-seminomatous testicular cancer can often be cured nowadays by cisplatin based chemotherapy. After chemotherapy, surgical resection is a generally accepted treatment to remove remnants of the initial metastases, since residual tumor may still be present. In the absence of tumor, resection has no therapeutic benefits, while it is associated with hospital admission, and risks of permanent morbidity and mortality. Logistic regression models were developed to predict the presence of residual tumor, combining  well-known predictors, such as the histology of the primary tumor, pre-chemotherapy levels of tumor markers, and (reduction in) residual mass size.  
The risk prediction model was developed in 544 patients using logistic regression with 5 predictors.  

We externally validated the 5 predictor model in 273 patients from a tertiary referral center (vdata) using the results (i.e., the coefficients) of the developed model. We illustrate ways to assess the usefulness of a model in a new setting. 

More details about development and validation data are provided in the manuscript ["Assessing the performance of prediction models: a framework for some traditional and novel measures"](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3575184/) by Steyerberg et al. (2010).

## Goal 1 - Assessing performance of a logistic regression risk prediction model

Here we evaluate the performance of the prediction model in terms of discrimination, calibration and overall prediction error. 

### 1.1 Estimate the predicted probabilities in the validation data
Logistic regression is used to predict the class (or category) of individuals based on one or multiple predictor variables (X). It is used to model a binary outcome, that is a variable, which can have only two possible values: 0 or 1, yes or no, diseased or non-diseased.  
The standard logistic regression function, for predicting the outcome of an observation given a predictor variable X), is:  

<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\huge{\sf{\hat{p}%3D%20\frac{exp(y)}{1-exp(y)}%20%3D%20\frac{exp(%5Cbeta_0%2B%5Cbeta_1X_1%2B%5Cbeta_2X_2%2B%5Cbeta_3X_3%2B%5Ccdots%2B%5Cbeta_pX_p)}{1-exp(%5Cbeta_0%2B%5Cbeta_1X_1%2B%5Cbeta_2X_2%2B%5Cbeta_3X_3%2B%5Ccdots%2B%5Cbeta_pX_p)}}}">  

By taking the logarithm of both sides, the formula becomes a linear combination of predictors:

vdata$pred <- exp(vdata$lp) / (1 + exp(vdata$lp))
```

### 1.1 Discrimination

We here calculate:  

+ The c-statistic: it is a rank order statistic for predictions against true outcomes. The concordance (c) statistic is the most commonly used performance measure to indicate the discriminative ability of generalized linear regression models. For a binary outcome, c is identical to the area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve, which plots the sensitivity (true positive rate) against 1 â€“ (false positive rate) for consecutive cutoffs for the probability of an outcome. Accurate predictions discriminate between those with and those without the outcome.

+ Discrimination slope: it can be used as a simple measure for how well subjects with and without the outcome are separated. It is calculated as the absolute difference in average predictions for those with and without the outcome. Visualization is readily possible with a box plot or a histogram, which will show less overlap between those with and those without the outcome for a better discriminating model.

C-statistic was 0.78 (95% CI: 0.73-0.84) in the validation data. Discrimination slope was 0.24 (95% CI: 0.18-0.28).  

### 2.2 Calibration
Calibration refers to the agreement between observed outcomes and predictions. For example, if we predict a 20% risk of residual tumor for a testicular cancer patient, the observed frequency of tumor should be approximately 20 out of 100 patients with such a prediction.

Different level of calibration can be estimated: mean, weak, and moderate calibration according to the calibration hierarchy defined by Van Calster et al. [here](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0895435615005818).  

#### 2.2.1 Mean calibration
Mean calibration refers how systematically the model might under- or over- predicts the actual risk.   

The mean calibration can be estimated:  

+ using the Observed and Expected ratio. The observed number of events is the sum of the events (or cases) present in the data. The expected is estimated summing the predicted probability of the event estimated by the model. Ratio equals to 1 indicates perfect (mean) calibration, values lower or greater than 1 indicate over- and under- prediction, respectively.

+ calibration intercept (or calibration-in-the-large): indicates the extent that predictions are systematically too low or too high.

                     family = binomial,
                     data = vdata)
intercept_CI <- confint(cal_intercept) # confidence intervals

# Observed/Expected ratio
Obs <- sum(vdata$y)
Expct <- sum(vdata$pred)

OE <- Obs / Expct

```

```{r, res_mean_cal, fig.align='center',echo=FALSE}
alpha <- .05
k <- 2
res_mean_cal <- matrix(c(
    cal_intercept$coefficients,
    
    intercept_CI[1],
    intercept_CI[2],
    
    OE,

    OE*exp(-qnorm(1 - alpha / 2) * sqrt(1 / Obs)),
    OE*exp(qnorm(1 - alpha / 2) * sqrt(1 / Obs))
),
  nrow = 2,
  ncol = 3, 
  byrow = T,
  dimnames = list(
    c("Calibration intercept", "O/E ratio"),
    c("Estimate", "Lower .95 ", "Upper .95"))
)

res_mean_cal <- round(res_mean_cal, 2) # Digits
kable(res_mean_cal) |>
  kable_styling("striped", position = "center") 

```
Both calibration intercept and O/E ratio showed good mean calibration.
The prediction model did not systematically over or underestimate the actual risk. 

#### 2.2.2 Weak calibration
The term â€˜weakâ€™ refers to the limited flexibility in assessing calibration. We are essentially summarizing calibration of the observed proportions of outcomes versus predicted probabilities using only two parameters i.e. a straight line. In other words, perfect weak
calibration is defined as mean calibration ratio and calibration slope of unity(or calibration intercept equals to zero). 
The calibration slope indicates the overall strength of the linear predictor (LP), which can be interpreted as the level of overfitting
(slope <1) or underfitting (slope>1). A value of slope smaller than 1 can also be interpreted as reflecting a need for shrinkage of regression coefficients in a prediction model.

res_weak_cal <- round(res_weak_cal, 2) # Digits
kable(res_weak_cal) |>
  kable_styling("striped", position = "center") 
```


#### 2.2.3 Moderate calibration
Moderate calibration concerns whether among patients with the same predicted risk, the observed event rate equals the predicted risk. A graphical assessment of calibration is possible with predictions on the x-axis, and the outcome on the y-axis. Perfect predictions should be on the 45Â° line.  For binary outcomes, the plot contains only 0 and 1 values for the y-axis. Smoothing techniques can be used to estimate
the observed probabilities of the outcome (p(y=1)) in relation to the predicted probabilities, e.g. using the lowess algorithm. The observed probabilities can be also estimated using a secondary logistic regression model using the predicted probability as predictor modelled with splines. We may however expect that the specific type of smoothing may affect the graphical impression, especially in smaller data sets.

```
Calibration measures (i.e., ICI, E50, E90) using a 'secondary' logistic regression to estimate the observed probability of the event indicate good calibration.  
Calibration measures might also be calculated using the non-parametric method (e.g., lowess) to estimate the observed probability of the event. In this setting, the user can use the results of ```stats::lowess()``` function to calculate the absolute difference between the estimated observed and predicted probabilities. Another nice function to provide the calibration plot and the corresponding performance measures is ```rms::val.prob()```. Another alternative is ```riskRegression::Score()```.  


### 2.3 Overall performance measures
The overall performance measures generally estimate the distance between the predicted outcome and actual outcome.  
We calculate the Brier Score, and the scaled Brier scale (also known as index of prediction accuracy) and the corresponding confidence intervals.

Some confidence intervals are calculated using the bootstrap percentile method.

## Goal 3 -  Clinical utility
Discrimination and calibration measures are essential to assess the prediction performance but insufficient to evaluate the potential clinical utility of a risk prediction model for decision making. When new markers are available, clinical utility assessment evaluates whether the extended model helps to improve decision making.  
Clinical utility is measured by the net benefit that includes the number of true positives and the number of false positives.
Generally, in medicine, clinicians accepts to treat a certain number of patients for which interventions are unnecessary to be event free for a given time horizon. So, false negatives (the harm of not being event free for a given time horizon) are more important than false positives (the harm of unnecessary interventions). Thus, net benefit is the number of true positives classifications minus the false positives classifications weighted by a factor related to the harm of not preventing the event versus unnecessary interventions. The weighting is derived from the threshold probability to the event of interest (e.g. residual tumor). For example, a threshold of 20% implies that additional interventions for 4 patients of whom one would have experience the event if untreated is acceptable (thus treating 3 unnecessary patients). This strategy is compared with the strategies of treat all and treat none patients. If overtreatment is harmful, a higher threshold should be used. 

The net benefit is calculated as:

*TP*=true positive patients   
*FP*=false positive patients  
*n*=number of patients and *p*<sub>t</sub> is the risk threshold.  

  
The decision curve is calculated as follows:
  
1. Choose a time horizon;
2. Specify a risk threshold which reflects the ratio between harms and benefit of an additional intervention;
3. Calculate the number of true positive and false positive given the threshold specified in (2);
4. Calculate the net benefit of the risk prediction model;
5. Plot net benefit on the *y-axis* against the risk threshold on the *x-axis*;
6. Repeat steps 2-4 for each model consideration;
7. Repeat steps 2-4 for the strategy of assuming all patients are treated;
8. Draw a straight line parallel to the *x-axis* at y=0 representing the net benefit associated with the strategy of assuming that all patients are not treated.

Given some thresholds, the model/strategy with higher net benefit represents the one that potentially improves  clinical decision making. However, poor discrimination and calibration lead to lower net benefit.

A cut-off of 20% implies a relative weight of 1:4 for false-positive decisions against true-positive decisions. In the development data, the Net Benefit (NB) was 0.653. This means that the model might identify approximately 65 patients out of 100 who may have residuals tumors and then tumor resection might be useful. If we would do resection in all, the NB would however be similar: 0.652 so the clinical utility of the model at 20% threshold is very limited. 

However, the decision curve shows that the NB would be much larger for higher threshold values, i.e. patients accepting higher risks of residual tumor. 

Moreover, potential net benefit can be defined in terms of reduction of avoidable interventions (e.g tumor resection per 100 patients) by:
  
<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=%5Chuge%7B%5Cfrac%7BNB_%7Bmodel%7D%20-%20NB_%7Ball%7D%7D%7B(p_t%2F%20(1-p_t))%7D*100%7D%0A">  
  
where *NB*<sub>model</sub> is the net benefit of the prediction model, *NB*<sub>all</sub> is the net benefit of the strategy treat all and $p_{t}$ is the risk threshold.
